  QUICK OVERVIEW ON WHY BABEL IS SET UP THE WAY IT IS BELOW:

  If you are authoring an app, use import 'core-js at the top of your app with
  'useBuiltIns' set to 'entry' and '@babel/transform-runtime' only for helpers
  ('@babel/runtime' as dependency). This way you pollute the global environment
  but you don't care, its your app. You will have the benefit of helpers aliased
  to '@babel/runtime' and polyfills included at the top of your app.
  This way you also don't need to process 'node_modules'
  (except when a dependency uses a syntax that has to be transpiled)
  because if some dependency used a feature that needs a polyfill, you already
  included that polyfill at the top of your app.
